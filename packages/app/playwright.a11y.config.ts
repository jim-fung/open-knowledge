/**
 * A11y Playwright config — per-worker fixture isolation (same shape as
 * `playwright.config.ts`).
 *
 * This config uses a per-worker fixture instead of a shared `webServer`
 * block + top-level `mkdtempSync`. The shared shape was abandoned in the
 * main Playwright config (see `playwright.config.ts` for the rationale:
 * cross-worker CPU contention + flake class on one shared Vite+Hocuspocus).
 *
 * The shared-webServer approach ALSO silently broke on macOS: Node's
 * global `fetch` inside the Playwright test worker tries IPv6 (`::1`)
 * before IPv4 on `localhost`, and Vite binds IPv4-only, producing
 * `TypeError: fetch failed / [cause]: AggregateError` on every
 * `test.beforeEach` call to `/api/test-reset`. Manual `curl` works; test-
 * worker `fetch` does not. The per-worker fixture pattern sidesteps this
 * because the fixture's own `fetch` polling happens outside the test
 * worker's Node-fetch context AND the tests consume the baseURL via a
 * fixture variable rather than a `process.env.VITE_PORT` lookup.
 *
 * Tests consume `test` + `api` + `baseURL` from
 * `tests/stress/_helpers/fixtures.ts` — same entry point as the main
 * Playwright suite. No a11y-specific fixture file; the shared one works
 * because it exposes what a11y needs (per-worker server + API helpers).
 */

/**
 * Off-CI worker count is derived from the same per-worker density as the main
 * suite rather than left to Playwright's default, because this config consumes
 * the identical per-worker fixture: each worker owns a full Vite + Hocuspocus +
 * Chromium stack, not just a browser. `check:full:parallel` runs this tier
 * concurrently with the e2e tier at `--concurrency=100%`, so an unbounded
 * default here would re-import the oversubscription the main config now avoids.
